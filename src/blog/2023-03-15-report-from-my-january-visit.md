Today, volunteers of the “Medical-Psychological Aid” visited three different shelters in the Lviv region. Valentyn Bordun, together with Mark Johnson, first visited the Univska Lavra, where 40 people of different age and categories currently live. The light from the generators will illuminate the places where IDPs live and work, making candles.

Our next visit was to the village of Zabolotsi, where there is a shelter for people who find themselves in a difficult life situation. This place has become a refuge for the elderly, people with disabilities and serious illnesses. However, despite the difficult circumstances, constant blackouts and air raid signals, these people do not lose hope. So came to those people to provide their basic needs such adult diapers, warm clothes and shoes. And the most important part it’s two generators that can fully cover those small building.

Now he uses a notepad on a tablet to write about what he would like to say. When we asked what he would like most now, the answer was simple - to be able to talk to his family again. Why does he need a working phone with Messengers to write to his relatives.")
