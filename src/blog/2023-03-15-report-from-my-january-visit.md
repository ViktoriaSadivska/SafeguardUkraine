Today, volunteers of the “Medical-Psychological Aid” visited three different shelters in the Lviv region. Valentyn Bordun, together with Mark Johnson, first visited the Univska Lavra, where 40 people of different age and categories currently live. The light from the generators will illuminate the places where IDPs live and work, making candles.

Our next visit was to the village of Zabolotsi, where there is a shelter for people who find themselves in a difficult life situation. This place has become a refuge for the elderly, people with disabilities and serious illnesses. However, despite the difficult circumstances, constant blackouts and air raid signals, these people do not lose hope. So came to those people to provide their basic needs such adult diapers, warm clothes and shoes. And the most important part it’s two generators that can fully cover those small building.

This is Volodymyr from Seversk, who suffered several strokes after which he lost the ability to speak and coordinate his movements. Now he uses a notepad on a tablet to write about what he would like to say. When we asked what he would like most now, the answer was simple - to be able to talk to his family again. Why does he need a working phone with Messengers to write to his relatives.

Anatoly too
Came from Seversk. Not having the opportunity to leave on his own, he was alone for several months waiting for volunteers who could help him leave for safe territory. Now, after a stroke, Anatoly dreams of continuing to paint and create art.

This lady's name is Iryna, she is already 4 months lives in this shelter. Iryna was our guide in the shelter and optimistically showed and told about everything, although she went through all the horrors of the war during her evacuation. Iryna is currently undergoing rehabilitation after a stroke and hopes to return to her hometown of Soledar in the near future.

Our last visit was the shelter in the village Biliy Kamin . Despite the difficulties with getting there and fatigue, we were greeted joyfully by the head of the shelter, Mrs. Olya. This shelter is currently home to 70 IDPs who are housed on 4 floors. The old model of the building is in dire need of insulation and heating, which is turned off due to the lack of light. We were in the room in outerwear and within 30 minutes of the visit it was freezing, and the people who live there have been fighting these conditions for almost a year. The generator and the warm things we gave will allow these people to warm up and continue their struggle.
Thank you Mark Johnson, thank you to every donator
Together to victory
